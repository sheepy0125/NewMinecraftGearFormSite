# Deployment scripts

Before running any of these scripts, run (in the root directory!)

```zsh
$ npx yarn build
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

These scripts assume that the CWD is in `/scripts`, so run

```zsh
$ cd scripts
```

if you're still in the root directory.

They also are for Windows, but will work just fine on \*NIX if `pause` is removed or changed to `read`.
